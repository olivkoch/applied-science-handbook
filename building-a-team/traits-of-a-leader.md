[DRAFT]

In the 10X things business

Autonomy, responsibilty, transprarency
	- Autonomy: whatever the level
	- Responsibility: extreme ownership
	- Transparency: do what you say, say what you do, default to open

Always keep building. Stay close to the tooling.  Help the team.  Don't stand on the critical path.  Learn new things. Safety margins don't scale: in a chain of command, if everyone takes a 10% margin, you've doubled the estimate.

No safety margin. If you say you will do it by tuesday and could do it by Monday, the trust is damaged.

Iteration speed and rigor of experimentation

A marathon, not a sprint

Default to open

Speak your mind. Not giving hard feedback is tantamount to disloyalty.

Genuine honesty. People won't remember what you said or what you did, they will remember how you made them feel. Time is the real currency.

Be the change you want to see
