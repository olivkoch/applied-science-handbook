The business of 10X things

I often tell my team that we are in the business of 10X things.

That's what we do: we build things that people things could not exist.

How to do this?

Spend time with customers.

Push the technologies to its limits.

Keep iterating between the two and build a mental model of the killer product.

Stick to first principles, not analogies. u-boat 30% faster if latest material and AI-optimized hull?

Use rules of thumbs: software can be made 10X faster. Physical world: Navier-Stoke equations

10x things are hard to find. Use the 5 why rule.

Examples:

- Bad: I can make this component 10X faster.

- OK: I can make this component 10X faster which saves $3M in compute. Good, but how big of a deal is this, and how long will we keep this component in prod?

- Good:

- Great:


== How to deliver 10X things

If you're in the business of 10X things and you operate as a leader, you end up asking yourself: how do I deliver on these great things with my team?

The traditional way of doing this is through personal goals and detailed project planning.

Both fail at delivering truly transformative change.

Sure, some level of planning is important (and so is financial rigor and accountability)

But the way to drive the team is as follows:

1. Build an inspiring, world-changing vision. This vision must cristalize itself into a concrete product vision.
2. Derive milestones through backprop. Build a DAG.
3. Make your workplace a (healthy) marketplace

It does not really matter to be late as long as you are on the right path (see: Slow is smooth, smooth is fast).

If you do this, two things happen:

1. Little planning overhead. Teams define their own OKRs autonomously.
2. No personal goals. The workplace is a marketplace. The best ideas win. Everyone is assumed to be autonomous.
