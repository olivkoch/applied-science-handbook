# Writing an effective performance review

*"Why would one spend a year working hard for their company and not two hours explaining what they did?"*

The performance review is an important moment in your career.  This is the moment where you pay tribute to all the hard work you've put into your company/product. We provide a few tips to make it as effectively as possible.

## Be concise

- Your review will fail to gain attention if you dump a massive block of text. 
- Cut to the chase. Break it down into sections.
- Cut down each delivery into 1-2 sentences.
- Iterate on it until the performance review is crystal-clear

## Focus on your top deliveries

- There's likely only a few deliveries that made a real difference. Focus on those.
- Second-order deliveries may weaken your review more than anything else. Consider skipping them or packaging them together.

## Explain the impact

- Put it into numbers (e.g. "This led to an increase of 5% in metric X for product Y")
- Put it into perspective (e.g. "This is the second best increase in metric X in two years")
- Make the connection to the *product* and the *business*. Why did your delivery matter in the end?
- If you're not doing this last step, you're putting the burden on your lead to explain why you made a difference to the company.

## Take a holistic view to your role

- Did you cover all aspects of your role in your deliveries?
- Taking an "outside-in" view on your role helps you make sure you did not miss anything
- This also helps you wrap your review into a couple of impactful sentences
- This also helps you identify areas of growth/opportunities

## Why did you not get promoted?

- Ask yourself this hard question and try to answer it truthfully
- This should help you identify areas of growth/opportunities and gather material for an interesting conversation with your lead

## Ask for feedback

- If this is the first time you are doing a performance review, or if this review is critical (e.g. for a promo), consider asking for feedback from people you trust
