[DRAFT]

In this article I would like to speak my mind about what, in the hindsight, made a difference in my career. In other words: the career advice I wish I had received when I was 20.

I'll start with a background image, that of the famous Michelangelo's Creation of Adam painting. This is what a career in science and engineering really looks like. And right now you don't know what I am talking about, but my goal today is to try to convey a few simple messages around this.

If you've spent time in a great capital of the world, you have a hint in front of you. All the great names on buildings like the Pantheon and the Eiffel tower. They are here to remind us that we can make a dent in the world. We can aim for greatness. A lot of you will not want to do this. They will be happy cruising through their life. And that's fine. That's a very respectable choice. I don't want to sound dismissive to them. I am not trying to convince you that you should aim to get your name on the Eiffel tower. But those names are inspirations to do great things.

I am talking to two kinds of people in this room: those who know what I am talking about but don't know how to approach it. And maybe even more importantly, those who don't know what I am talking about, but will understand it years from now. And you don't want to wake up 10 years from now realizing that you failed to aim for greatness.

Life is not short. A lot of people will tell you that your life goes like this (snap fingers) but that is not true. Life is what you make of it. However, right now, you are sitting comfortably in your chair thinking that you have your entire life in front of you. That's true, but this truth is poison. Because the reverse is also true: what you have in front of you is all you've got. And you should think very carefully about what to do with it.

So here are three principles you should follow if you want to aim for greatness.

- Work your ass off.  There's no shortcut in life. Moving the needle requires hard work. But people often misunderstand this. They think you should make your life miserable. It will be true sometimes. Your life will be miserable at times! But really, the key is that you should seek high intensity. You don't know what the jar of your life will be made of. The jar image is deceiving, because you only know that a big rock made it to your jar in the hindsight. It's not like you look at a big rock and say: "oh great, that's gonna be a nice 62% of my jar". This would be too easy and too boring. The way it works is that you spend countless hours, weeks and months working hard after a problem and only realize years later that this was worth pursuing. But the question remains: what are you working hard after right now? What keeps you up at night? If you don't have an answer to this question, you're on a random walk.

- Find your mentor. Find your Marie Curie, your Richard Feynman, your Seymour Cray. And don't give up until you find them. How do you know you did? They will raise the bar for you. They will do great things. Look at their accomplishments. Look at what people do after they work with them. Keep looking for these people in your career and try to work with them, not just spend time near them. Great mentors generate both great pain and great happiness. This is another counter-intuitive aspects of life. We tend to think that pain and happiness correlate, but they really don't. If you look back in your career and point to the moments that you remember the most, you will often recollect a lot of pain and happiness at the same time.

- Seek greatness, not intelligence. There is this big illusion we have grown into in the higher education system of the Western World. We are trained to think that people are intelligent or not and that only the intelligent ones get to change the world. That's not how things work! Do you think that Curie, Feynman and Cray got good grades their whole life? No! Quote Jensen Huang: greatness does not come from intelligence, it comes from character. Character comes from your early experience in life. Character is grit and perseverance. I spent many years at MIT and the single thing that people had in common was this: grit. So, give up on the idea that the most intelligent people will change the world and build grit.

Don't let anyone ever fool you into thinking that you can't be great. Not just very good. Great.

If you do all this, you can make a dent in the world. 

Thank you.
